            SENSING</b></h5>
            <p> Lahore, Pakistan Sept 2022 – May 2023</p>

            <p>
                Our final year project in which we are using satellite data (MODIS) and ground data (Collected from different points 
                and tested in lab) through which we are predicting the soil texture and electrical conductivity in real time using 
                machine learning techniques.<br><br>

                <b>1:- Teamwork:</b> Worked with the team of 3 members. I was the Team Lead. <br>

                <b>2:- Documentation:</b> From the proposals to the final thesis and progress documents. We used Latex for these all. <br>

                 <b>3:- Research:</b> I studied different researches as our project was research based and presented the overall   
                summary. <br>
